# INFO ABOUT THE APP DEV STATE

For production there shoud be better naming convention. No mixing of compressing and encoding. Use only on concept!

Flags could use common naming conventions with shorthand and long version.

ie. --file / -f

Automatic detection of server port would be convenient.

...and a various other small improvements :)
